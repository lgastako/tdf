# sized-indexes

This is my attempt to provide a Haskellized implementation of the indexes that
Pandas provides.

Specifically one of my primary goals is to make all indexes fixed-sized in the
same sense as `vector-sized`.

These are intended to be used as the indexes in the typed data frame library
I'm working on.
